# personal-ai-assistant-robot
This is a personal AI assistant robot. Powered by OpenAI's Realtime API and having the ability to integrate with smart home devices, it can have a conversation in real time, answer questions, perform tasks and move around, all whilst being able to display information and animations on its front facing oled, and control its build in addressable led lights. This inital version (v1) is a basic MVP to test how everything will come together, but future versions will include temperature, light intensity and touch sensors, a camera and an auto charging dock.

I began this project mainly because I was getting frustrated with my alexa not being able to understand anything more complex than 'set a timer', and now with how advanced LLM's are getting I thought It would be a nice opportunity to create my own version of a home assistant who could actually hold a conversaion but also do everything the alexa could (appart from 'speaker' aspect). All whilst having the enjoyment that comes from working on a project like this.
